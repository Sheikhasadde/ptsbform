                    Loans.</p>
                    <p>The following warning applies in the case of fixed rate loans:</p>
                    <h2 className="font-weight-bold black-box">WARNING: YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY CHARGES IF YOU PAY
                    OFF A FIXED RATE LOAN EARLY.</h2>
                    <p className="font-weight-bold">Fixed Rate Loans</p>
                    <p>Whenever (i) repayment of a loan in full or in part is made or (ii) with the
                        agreement of permanent tsb, the loan is switched to a variable rate loan or
                        other fixed rate loan, before expiry of the Fixed Rate period (hereinafter called
                        the “Early Termination”), the applicant shall, in addition to all other sums
                        payable as a condition of and at the time of the Early Termination, pay a sum
                        equal to the permanent tsb’s estimate of the loss (if any) arising from the Early
                        Termination. In the calculation of the said loss, permanent tsb shall endeavour
                    to apply in so far as it is fair and practicable.</p>
                    <p>This is how the fee is calculated;</p>
                    <p>C = (I-S) x R x (M-T)/12</p>
                    <p>“C” is the charge to compensate for the loss (if greater than 0),</p>
                    <p>“I” is the swap/market fixed interest rate for the term of the Fixed Rate Period
                    at the date of its commencement,</p>
                    <p>“S” is the swap/market interest rate for the remaining fixed period,</p>
                    <p>“R” is the amount of the Fixed Rate loan balance paid or switched at the date of
                    Early Termination,</p>
                    <p>“M” is the fixed Rate Period (in months) and,</p>
                    <p>“T” is the time expired of the Fixed Rate Period at the date of Early Termination
                    (in months).</p>
                    <p>Here is a worked example; “I” = 5%, “S” = 3%, “R” = €100,000, “M” = 24
                    months, “T” = 12 months.</p>
                    <p>C = (5%-3%) x €100,000 x (24-12) / 12</p>
                    <p>So, C = 2% x €100,000 x 12 / 12</p>
                    <p>C = €2,000</p>
                    <p className="font-weight-bold">Valuation</p>
                    <p>A valuation must be carried out on the property you intend buying and a
                        valuation fee must be paid. The maximum valuation fee is e130 which includes
                        VAT but excludes valuer’s travel expenses. The valuer’s travel expenses are:
                        1-10 miles = Nil; 11-20 miles = 6; 21-25 miles = 8. Properties incomplete at
                        the time of the original valuation will require, on completion, a final valuation,
                        the fee for which is €65 which includes VAT but excludes travel expenses.
                        Additional loans will require an Opinion of Value (“drive by” valuation) the
                        fee for which is €65 which includes VAT but excludes travel expenses. The
                    valuation fee is refunded if the application is not accepted.</p>
