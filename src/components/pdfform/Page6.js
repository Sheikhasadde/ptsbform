        Information about the Financial Service
      </h2>
      <ol start="3">
        <li>
          The purpose of this schedule is to summarise for you the key features
          of our housing loans. Those key features are:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul className="double-arrow-list">
        <li>
          Housing loans are available to persons who meet our credit criteria;
        </li>
        <li>
          Housing loans (including interest) are repayable over an agreed period
          normally between 10 to 35 years by monthly or other periodic
          instalments;
        </li>
        <li>
          There are a number of different types of housing loan which may be
          repaid as follows;
          <br />- in the case of an annuity or repayment loan, by repayments of
          principal and interest; or <br />- in the case of a bridging loan
          either by monthly repayments comprising of interest only with the
          principal being repaid on expiry of the loan term or by deferral of
          all repayments until expiry of the loan term whereupon the principal
          and all interest accrued thereon are repaid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interest on housing loans is payable at a rate which will vary over
          the term of the loan in accordance with prevailing interest rates or,
          if we so agree at your request, our applicable fixed rate for fixed
          periods;
        </li>
        <li>
          Housing loans are secured by a mortgage over your property and any
          additional security that may be required by us;
        </li>
        <li>
          If you make any default in repayment, we may repossess your property
          on foot of the mortgage and realise any security given to us and you
          must pay to us the costs and expenses that we incur in recovering
          payment from you;
        </li>
        <li>
          Fees - A valuation report fee is payable, the maximum fee being
          €130.00 which includes VAT.
          <br />
          A valuers travel expenses are payable as follows:-
          <br />
          1-10 miles = nil
          <br />
          11-20 miles = €6.00
          <br />
          21-25 miles = €8.00
          <br />A fee of €35.00 is charged for any request to release your title
          deeds to your solicitor and also for vacating or releasing your
          mortgage. These and the other applicable terms and conditions will be
          set out in a contract which will be signed by you and us and the
          mortgage which you give us over your property.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol start="4">
        <li>
          There may be additional costs or taxes payable by you which are not
          paid by us or imposed by us such as stamp duty, registration fees and
          your solicitor’s fees and mortgage protection insurance and home
          insurance premiums.
        </li>
        <li>
          This information is correct at the date it is sent to you. The
          examples of the total cost payable by you are illustrative only, and
          the actual total cost will depend on prevailing rates of interest, in
          the case of a variable rate loan, throughout the period of the loan,
          and, in the case of a fixed rate loan, at the time the loan is drawn
          down
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 className="font-weight-bold color-primary">
        Your right to cancel the contract
      </h2>
      <ol start="6">
        <li>
          You do not have a right to cancel the contract once you have drawn
          down a housing loan but you may repay a housing loan early as outlined
          in the next paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever (i) repayment of a loan in full or in part is made or (ii)
          with the agreement of permanent tsb, the loan is switched to a
          variable rate loan or other fixed rate loan, before expiry of the
          Fixed Rate period (hereinafter called the “Early Termination”), the
          applicant shall, in addition to all other sums payable as a condition
          of and at the time of the Early Termination, pay a sum equal to the
          permanent tsb’s estimate of the loss (if any) arising from the Early
          Termination. In the calculation of the said loss, permanent tsb shall
          endeavour to apply in so far as it is fair and practicable. This is
          how the fee is calculated; C = (I-S) x R x (M-T)/12 “C” is the charge
          to compensate for the loss (if greater than 0), “I” is the swap/market
          fixed interest rate for the term of the Fixed Rate Period at the date
          of its commencement, “S” is the swap/market interest rate for the
          remaining fixed period, “R” is the amount of the Fixed Rate loan
          balance paid or switched at the date of Early Termination, “M” is the
          fixed Rate Period (in months) and, “T” is the time expired of the
          Fixed Rate Period at the date of Early Termination (in months). Here
          is a worked example; “I” = 5%, “S” = 3%, “R” = €100,000, “M” = 24
          months, “T” = 12 months. C = (5%-3%) x €100,000 x (24-12) / 12 So, C =
          2% x €100,000 x 12 / 12, C = €2,000
        </li>
        <li>
          If you fail to make any payment due to us in respect of the loan or,
          if any of the other events of default which will be specified in the
          contract between us for the loan were to occur we may call for the
          immediate repayment of the loan together with all accrued but unpaid
          interest thereon and all other costs and expenses payable under the
          contract. We may also enforce our mortgage over your property and sell
          it and realise any security given to us and apply the proceeds of sale
          in repayment of the loan and all interest and costs and expenses.
